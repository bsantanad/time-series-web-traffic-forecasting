    ABSTRACT = {Evaluating web traffic on a web server is highly critical for web service providers since, without a proper demand forecast, customers could have lengthy waiting times and abandon that website. However, this is a challenging task since it requires making reliable predictions based on the arbitrary nature of human behavior. We introduce an architecture that collects source data and in a supervised way performs the forecasting of the time series of the page views. Based on the Wikipedia page views dataset proposed in a competition by Kaggle in 2017, we created an updated version of it for the years 2018–2020. This dataset is processed and the features and hidden patterns in data are obtained for later designing an advanced version of a recurrent neural network called Long Short-Term Memory. This AI model is distributed training, according to the paradigm called data parallelism and using the Downpour training strategy. Predictions made for the seven dominant languages in the dataset are accurate with loss function and measurement error in reasonable ranges. Despite the fact that the analyzed time series have fairly bad patterns of seasonality and trend, the predictions have been quite good, evidencing that an analysis of the hidden patterns and the features extraction before the design of the AI model enhances the model accuracy. In addition, the improvement of the accuracy of the model with the distributed training is remarkable. Since the task of predicting web traffic in as precise quantities as possible requires large datasets, we designed a forecasting system to be accurate despite having limited data in the dataset. We tested the proposed model on the new Wikipedia page views dataset we created and obtained a highly accurate prediction; actually, the mean absolute error of predictions regarding the original one on average is below 30. This represents a significant step forward in the field of time series prediction for web traffic forecasting.},

 abstract = {Recently, methods for detecting unit roots in autoregressive and autoregressive-moving average time series have been proposed. The presence of a unit root indicates that the time series is not stationary but that differencing will reduce it to stationarity. The tests proposed to data require specification of the number of autoregressive and moving average coefficients in the model. In this paper we develop a test for unit roots which is based on an approximation of an autoregressive-moving average model by an autoregression. The test statistic is standard output from most regression programs and has a limit distribution whose percentiles have been tabulated. An example is provided.},
